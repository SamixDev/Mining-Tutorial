    We have seen a noticable increase in interest in mining crypto in 2021 since early 2018 and especially mining Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    This interest in mining is the result of the massive increase in cryptocurrency values,faster adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide
    and the release of the new VGA cards that have a really strong mining power. 
</p>
<p>
    Bitcoin is mined using ASIC miners that use the SHA-256 algorithm, and it is not that profitable nowadays because ASIC miners 
    have seen a big power increase for a really long time and the new generation of ASIC miners are slightly better than the older generation.     
</p>
<p>
    Ethereum on the contrary have seen a really big increase in interest of mining it since this cryptocurrency requires VGA cards.
Ethereum uses Ethash which is a proof-of-work mining algorithm implemented by the Ethereum network and Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies.
Ethash is a successor of the previous Ethereum algorithm called Dagger-Hashimoto and is, in fact, an upgrade of it.
The new series of VGA cards offer much better performance and much more energy efficiency than the older series.
To be able to mine Ethereum now, you need a graphic card with at least 6Gb of VRAM, before you required much less VRAM but this 
is due to the size of the DAG file that is constantly increasing, it grows by 8MB every 30 thousand blocks.
Any VGA card that has 6+ GB VRAM can mine ETH from GTX 1060 6GB to RTX 3090.
These cards are available everywhere and easier to get hands on, so if you have a VGA card right now, well... good news you can mine!
